# Muksa

Muksa is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform built on Venom Network. It provides functionality similar to Snapshot and serves as a useful tool for those looking to create a DAO on Venom Network. With Muksa, you can quickly create a DAO and it will assist you in creating a new currency, allowing you to focus on how to allocate these currencies. Subsequently, currency holders can publish new proposals and make choices based on their opinions within the proposals.

If you're interested in contributing to the development, this platform is built using Blitz.js. You can find most of the information in the [Blitz.js documentation](https://blitzjs.com/docs/get-started).

## Features

- Create and manage decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) on Venom Network.
- Quickly establish new currencies within your DAO.
- Publish and participate in proposals within the DAO.
- Make informed decisions based on community voting.
